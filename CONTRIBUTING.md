# Contributing to simple-es
First off, thanks for wanting to contribute to this project!

I have been watching a few ES client projects in Rust and looked into contributing to some but they all went in directions that I did not fully agree with. The objective of this project is to create a idiomatic Rust based client, so with that in mind please follow these simple rules.
- As much as possible, try not to introduce non-idiomatic code (i.e. enum match statements are your friend).
- Try as much as possible not to introduce overly complex logic/structure, this is meant to be simple and readable.

## License
This project uses the MIT or Apache-2 license, so contributors to this project MUST agree to both their terms and conditions to be able to submit or request changes in this project.

## Tickets
Before opening up a new Ticket, please follow these simple rules:  
- Check to see if there is already an existing Issue Ticket that describes the Enhancement, Feature, or Bug that you would like to share.
- If there is a similar Issue but it doesn't quite address the idea/problem you are reporting, add a comment first to see if that Ticket can be expanded or if a separate Ticket needs to be created.
- For opening Bug Tickets, please include the following:
  - Title that captures the problem identified, starting with `[Bug]`
  - Clear description of the problem, with as much information as you can provide
  - Steps to reproduce the problem
  - Screenshot of the Log outputs or compiler errors

## Pull Requests
Whenever possible, please include tests to keep the code coverage as high as possible and to prevent future changes from breaking your new features. Also, help keep the doc comments up-to-date to continue making this project as accessible as possible to people using the crate and those contributing to it.

Happy contributing and welcome to the team!
